List of advanced functionality I have implemented; 

1.	 Website posts are open for comments from both users and administrators.
2.	User registration and login capabilities are available.
3.	Passwords are encrypted through hash and salt for added security and confidentiality.
4.	Email addresses are validated through email-validator.
5.	Regexp enforces strong password standards, requiring a minimum length of 8 characters with a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers.
6.	Email communication with the website owner is possible.
7.	Upon successful login, the 'register' and 'login' options disappear, and a 'log out' option becomes available.
8.	The website's grid system is adaptable to different devices (phone, iPad, PC) through the use of a flexbox grid.
9.	The website utilizes the WTF framework for efficient form generation.
